# Implementation of SMOTENC with MissForest for Missing Value Imputation to Predict Hepatitis Patient Survival Using Naive Bayes and RandomForest Classification

Implementasi SMOTENC Dengan MissForest Untuk Perbaikan Missing Value Pada Keberlangsungan Hidup Pasien Hepatitis Menggunakan Klasifikasi Naive Bayes dan RandomForest

This research aims to implement the SMOTENC technique using the MissForest algorithms for handling missing values in the hepatitis dataset, with a focus on predicting patient survival. The Naive Bayes and RandomForest classification methods are used to analyze the prediction results. The dataset used in this study contains clinical information of hepatitis patients, including data with missing values. The SMOTENC technique is employed to handle missing categorical data, while the MissForest algorithms are utilized to address missing numerical data. The imputed values from the missing data are used as inputs for the Naive Bayes and RandomForest classification models to predict patient survival. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the implemented imputation techniques. The results of this study are expected to provide better insights into addressing missing data in the hepatitis dataset and improving the accuracy of predicting patient survival.
